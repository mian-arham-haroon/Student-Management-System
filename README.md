# Student Registration System using Tkinter, OpenPyXL & Pillow

Welcome to the **Student Registration System**, a Python GUI-based application developed using **Tkinter** for the interface, **OpenPyXL** for Excel file integration, and **Pillow** for image handling. This project demonstrates how to create a fully functional data-entry system for students that is both beginner-friendly and professionally structured.

---

## üîç Overview

The Student Registration System allows users to input student information, capture and store their image, and save all data into an Excel file with a single click. Designed as a desktop application, it runs on any system with Python installed. Screenshots are included to provide a clear visual guide on using the application.
